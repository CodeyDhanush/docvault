# Fix GitHub Pages 404 Error

The 404 error happens because GitHub Pages needs proper configuration. Here's how to fix it:

## Problem: 
GitHub Pages can't find your website files because:
1. The build process isn't working correctly
2. GitHub Pages settings aren't configured properly
3. The file paths are incorrect for GitHub Pages

## Solution:

### Step 1: Update Your Repository
Upload these NEW/UPDATED files to your GitHub repository:

**New Files:**
- `client/package.json` - Frontend-specific dependencies
- `client/vite.config.ts` - Frontend build configuration  
- `GITHUB_PAGES_FIX.md` - This fix guide

**Updated Files:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Fixed GitHub Actions workflow
- `vite.config.client.ts` - Updated build settings

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages
1. Go to: https://github.com/CodeyDhanush/docvault/settings/pages
2. Source: **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
3. Save the settings

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Actions
1. Go to: https://github.com/CodeyDhanush/docvault/actions
2. If you see "Workflows aren't being run on this forked repository"
3. Click **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**

### Step 4: Trigger Build
1. Make any small change to README.md (add a space)
2. Commit the change
3. This will trigger the GitHub Actions build
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

### Step 5: Check Your Live Site
Your DocVault website will be available at:
**https://codeydhanush.github.io/docvault**

## What Changed:

### Fixed GitHub Actions Workflow:
- Added proper permissions for GitHub Pages
- Uses official GitHub Pages actions
- Builds in the correct directory
- Uploads build artifacts properly

### Fixed Vite Configuration:
- Set correct base path: `/docvault/`
- Fixed file paths for GitHub Pages hosting
- Separate client build configuration

### Proper File Structure:
```
Your Repository:
├── client/           (React frontend)
│   ├── package.json  (Frontend dependencies)
│   ├── vite.config.ts (Build config)
│   └── src/          (All React components)
├── server/           (Express backend - for local dev)
├── .github/workflows/ (Auto-deployment)
└── README.md
```

## Alternative: Simple Static Upload

If GitHub Actions still doesn't work:

1. Build locally:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. Upload the `client/dist` folder contents to a new branch called `gh-pages`

3. Set GitHub Pages to use `gh-pages` branch

Your DocVault website should now work perfectly on GitHub Pages!
